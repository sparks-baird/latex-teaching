The LaTeX document `main.tex` is under development. The goal for it's final form is to make it compatible with all the features of the auto-paper methods including the time-saving features of LaTeX packages.

## Overleaf
Overleaf has great LaTeX documentation, even if you're not using Overleaf. Start out with [Documentation Home](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page) and the linked [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). Also note that the [TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com) is a great resource as well. Google searches will often pull up links to either resource. Andrew Falkowski, one of Taylor Sparks' students, gave a [Tutorial for writing lab reports in LaTeX and Overleaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8y_KIs9JLs).

Some examples of LaTeX commands/packages for scientific documents are given in the following OverLeaf document which is linked with the **latex-teaching** repository:
