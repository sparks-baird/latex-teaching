   Hello world!

We present breakdown time data for various research activities in \cref{tab:breakdown}.
\input{tables/breakdown}

An example of an equation is Fick's second law (\cref{eq:fick-second}).
\input{equations/fick-second}

Once we've defined abbreviations in \texttt{abbrev.tex}, we can call those abbreviations using the \texttt{gls} command. In the case of ``machine learning'', the first usage of \texttt{gls} will give the full form as in \gls{ml}. The next usage of \texttt{gls} will give the abbreviated version as in \gls{ml}.
