   Hello world!

We present breakdown time data for various research activities in \cref{tab:breakdown}.
\input{tables/breakdown}

An example of an equation is Fick's second law (\cref{eq:fick-second}).
\input{equations/fick-second}

Once we've defined abbreviations in \texttt{abbrev.tex}, we can call those abbreviations using the \texttt{gls} command. In the case of ``machine learning'', the first usage of \texttt{gls} will give the full form as in \gls{ml}. The next usage of \texttt{gls} will give the abbreviated version as in \gls{ml}.

After we've included the bibliography file in the \texttt{bibliography} command, we can start citing articles using the \texttt{natbib} \texttt{cite} and \texttt{citet} commands, as in the following example:

\citet{wangMachineLearningMaterials2020a} emphasized the need for reproducible methods and benchmarking. Another work further emphasized the importance of these topics \cite{barnardBestPracticeLeads2020}.

Typesetting equations in Mathematica can be very effective. Here is an example of a teaching figure: \\ %For example, we have the following equation which demonstrates a possible representation of a crystal structure using Gaussian encodings of distances, angles, areas, and volumes defined by the crystal's atomic positions: \\

Figures and captions can be generated programmatically. For example:
